# kickstarter-analysis
Using Excel helped me find greater undertanding of data and helped me set the current project for success. 
## Overview of Project
 Louise wants to create a Crowdfunding play called Fever with a budget of ten thousand dollars. We were able to analyze the Crowdfunding data and determine whether specific factors make a Crowdfunding project campaign successful or not. 
### Purpose
Analyzing the data and using the findings and critical factors will help Louise set up a successful crowdfunding campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges ...
-We analyzed the crowdfunding data to help Louise make a data-driven decision using facts, metrics, and the data to guide her to make a strategic business decision. Our main objective was to identify critical factors to help Louise make strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. We created  Filters, Conditional Formatting, Finding Averages, Create Pivot Tables, Charting by category, subcategories, summary tables, charts, and graphs. We created a deep dive of the data creating extra filters, using Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of Spread, Identifying and addressing Outliers. We were able to identify the percentage funded, average donations, the number of successful, failed, canceled crowdfunding campaigns analyzing the ratio. We performed a statistical analysis on the goals and pledged where we found the mean, median, standard deviation, upper and lower quartile, and IQR. Based on these statistics, we found that the mean of the distribution is around the 3rd quartile, and the data follows similar distribution in each subset. We identified that large values drove the distribution. The standard deviation was rough twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed campaigns, where the standard deviation was closer to three times the IQR. The data presented failed drives with really high goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 There are two conclusions we can draw about the Outcomes-based on the Launch date. The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July, and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The data indicate that from 694 successful campaigns, we have a 76% success rate for campaigns with goals of less than $1000 and not greater than $4999. At the same time, we can see that a goal higher than $5000 has a 23% success rate. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 The formulas were time-consuming and sometimes confusing, but I overcame them with the exercises in the modules and resources.
## Results
There are two conclusions we can draw about the Outcomes-based on the Launch date. The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July, and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. Also,The data indicate that from 694 successful campaigns, we have a 76% success rate for campaigns with goals of less than $1000 and not greater than $4999. At the same time, we can see that a goal higher than $5000 has a 23% success rate. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  The data indicate that from 694 successful campaigns, we have a 76% success rate for campaigns with goals of less than $1000 and not greater than $4999. At the same time, we can see that a goal higher than $5000 has a 23% success rate. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  The data does not offer wheather the project was profitable or not. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 We can create tables, graphs with other Parent categories and subcategories to compare the data with other Campaigns besides theatrical play.
